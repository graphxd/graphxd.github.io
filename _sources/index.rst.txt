Graphs Across Domains
=====================

GraphXD connects scientists, researchers, and theorists interested in graphs
from a variety of fields.

Inspired by `TextXD <https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/textxd>`_ and `ImageXD
<https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/image-xd>`_, GraphXD is being developed by
fellows at UC Berkeley's Institute for Data Science (`BIDS
<https://bids.berkeley.edu>`_).
