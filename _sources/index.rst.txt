Graphs Across Domains
=====================

GraphXD connects scientists, researchers, and theorists interested in graphs
from a variety of fields.

Inspired by `TextXD <https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/textxd>`_ and `ImageXD
<https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/image-xd>`_, GraphXD is being developed by
fellows at UC Berkeley's Institute for Data Science (`BIDS
<https://bids.berkeley.edu>`_).
We plan to form a core group of 10 to 20 members from across the Berkeley campus,
which will meet regularly starting during the fall semester.
We have a tentative plan to host an inaugural workshop at BIDS prior to the
start of the spring semester (possibly January 10--12, 2018).
The inaugural workshop will include speakers and participants from outside
Berkeley.

Additional details will be posted here soon.
