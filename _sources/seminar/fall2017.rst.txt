| **Graph Clustering Algorithms**
| `Tselil Schramm <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tschramm/>`_ (`Simons Institute <https://simons.berkeley.edu/>`_, UC Berkeley)

One of the greatest advantages of representing data with graphs is access to
generic algorithms for analytic tasks, such as clustering. In this talk I will
describe some popular graph clustering algorithms, and explain why they are
well-motivated from a theoretical perspective.

|  **Spectral Sparsification of Graphs**
|  `Nikhil Srivastava <https://math.berkeley.edu/~nikhil/>`_ (`Mathematics <https://math.berkeley.edu/>`_, UC Berkeley)

Many important properties of an undirected graph manifest themselves spectrally
in the eigenvalues or quadratic forms of matrices related to the graph. For
instance, the connectivity structure, electrical properties, and random walk
behavior of a graph are determined by its Laplacian matrix. A spectral
sparsifier of a graph G is a sparse graph H on the same set of vertices such
that the Laplacians of H and G are close, so that H captures the spectral
behavior of G while being much cheaper to store and perform computations on. We
survey a line of work showing that spectral sparsifiers with constant degree
exist for every graph and can be computed efficiently.
