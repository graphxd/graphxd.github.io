| **Vector representations of graphs and the maximum cut problem**
| `David P. Williamson <http://www.davidpwilliamson.net/work>`_ (`Operations Research and Information Engineering <http://www.orie.cornell.edu/>`_, Cornell University)

In this talk, I will look at a classical problem from graph theory of finding a
large cut in a graph.  We'll start with a 1967 result of Erd≈ës that showed that
picking a random partition of the graph finds a cut that is at least half the
largest possible cut.  We'll then describe a result due to Goemans and myself
from 1995 that shows that by representing the graph as a set of vectors, one
per vertex, and optimizing the set, one can find a cut of size at least .878
the largest possible.  If time permits, we'll see an additional application of
this vector representation to either clustering or coloring.
