Seminar
=======

Once a month, the Berkeley GraphXD community gets together for an informal
presentation on open questions, new results, old results worth remembering, or
whatever is fit to entertain a crowd of scientists, researchers, and theorists
interested in graphs.

We meet 4:00--5:30 in Evans room 1011.
