Seminar
=======

Once a month, the Berkeley GraphXD community gets together, socializes, and
listens to an informal board presentation on open questions, new results,
old results worth not forgetting, or whatever is fit to entertain
a crowd of scientists, researchers, and theorists interested in graphs.
At the the GraphXD Seminar, we do not believe in using slides, waiting until
the end to ask questions, or stopping the speaker when he or she runs out of
time.

We meet 5:30--7:00 in Evans room 1011.
