Understanding the ecology and evolution of communities through networks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

| **Lauren Ponisio**

Prior to the use of networks to model community-level interactions between
species, ecology and evolution often focused on pair-wise interactions, which
vastly limited the scope of inference. Network theory has enabled ecologists to
uncover common topologies across different types of interactions and overturn
misconceptions about the ubiquity of specialization in interactions.  In
addition, models of network stability has enabled us to make predictions about
the robustness of communities to species loss and perturbations. The next step
to further our understanding of the dynamics of ecological communities include
methods to 1) compare networks beyond collapsing their topology into
quantitative metrics, 2) combine different types of networks (i.e, pollination,
seed dispersal, predation), 3) incorporate metadata into interaction strength
and node roles.  In addition, ecological data still relies on tedious data
collection by humans---innovations in metabarcoding and image processing will
also propel our understanding of ecological interactions forward.

A brief history of graph algorithms using spectral graph theory, part I
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

| **Aaron Schild**

Spectral graph theory started in the 80s, when Cheeger's inequality was used as
a means for constructing sparse and balanced cuts in a graph. In the 2000s, our
field moved on from studying specific eigenvalues to studying the whole
spectrum of the Laplacian matrix with fast Laplacian solvers. To obtain fast
Laplacian solvers, we needed to sparsify graphs, for which we exploited
concentration phenomena of random matrices. In the 2010s, improvements to these
tools led to improvements on a wide variety of problems, like maximum flow,
travelling salesman (both symmetric and asymetric), and random spanning tree
generation. In this talk, we briefly survey this chain of events and suggest
some future directions.

Graph abstractions in computational genomics
--------------------------------------------

| **Aydin Buluc**

Relationships among entities in genomics, such as proteins, DNA sequences, or
genetics markers, are often represented as graphs. Graph abstraction helped
solve many important computational genomics problems from building linkage maps
to genome assembly. In this talk, I will give a short overview on the
characteristics of the graphs that arise in key computational genomics tasks as
well as the fundamental algorithmic questions that are addressed using those
graphs.
