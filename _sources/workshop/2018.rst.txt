March 27--29, 2018
==================

`BIDS <https://bids.berkeley.edu>`_ will host a three day inaugural workshop in
the spring of 2018.
Topics will include interesting **data** represented as graphs,
graph **algorithms**, as well as **software** for creating, manipulating,
and studying the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
Depending on interest, we may also host a one day software bootcamp
focused on Python and `NetworkX <http://networkx.github.io/>`_
prior to the workshop.
